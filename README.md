I often want to preview multiple short videos together so I made this simple tool.

## Instructions
1. Simply open video_preview.html in a web browser. Then browse and select the files you wish to view.
1. You can change the background `color` by setting `background` attribute inside body in `preview_styles.css`.
1. You can change the text color by setting the `color` attribute inside `videoName` in `preview_styles.css`.
